# Retention Time Alignment algorithms for data coming at least from LC-MS

A Python module for everyone to use, for free, for ever.
(unless you offer us something, we're flexible)

Goals:

* Provide a set of tools for calibrating retention times, including
	* choice of the retention time
	* alignment using mass spec identifications
	* choice of the alignement using different cross-validation schemes
	* implementation of different alignment procedures:
		* splines
		* moving medians
	* implementation of different alignment strategies:
		* alignement to reference
		* hunt for better reference
	* plotting of the outputs
	* compatibility with rta module used for x-annotation of the aligned signals

This all should not last too long to execute, too.
