# To Do
* write tests for the spline fitting method
    how should this work?
* implement the CV that sends things to different groups within small consecutive batches
* realign the points and redo the calculations:
    


# Done
* is there any good of doing measure concentration on peptide-presence across runs?
    * not so much: relatively poor concentration properties
    * but did additional Stratified CV here
