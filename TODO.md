# To Do
* refactor the old 'robust spline' code to the new class structure. 
    * I want to have them working just in case
    * no Patsy 


# Done
* is there any good of doing measure concentration on peptide-presence across runs?
    * not so much: relatively poor concentration properties
    * but did additional Stratified CV here
